=head1 NAME

Patro::Archy - establish norms about exclusive access to references

=cut

# This is not necessarily just for Patro-proxy objects

=head1 DESCRIPTION

At times we want threads and processes to have exclusive access to
some resources, even if they have to wait for it. The C<Patro::Archy>
provides functions to request exclusive access to a resource and to
relinquish control of the resource. It also implements an additional
wait/notify feature.

The functions of C<Patro::Archy> all take the same two first
arguments: a reference -- the resource that will be used exclusively
in one thread or process, and an id that uniquely identifies a
thread or process that seeks exclusive access to a resource.

Like most such locks in Perl,
the locks from this package are advisory -- they can only
prevent access to the resource from other threads and processes
that use the same locking scheme.


=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 plock

=head2 $status = plock($object, $id [, $timeout])

Attempts to acquire an exclusive (but advisory) lock on the
reference given by C<$object> for a monitor identified by
C<$id>. Returns true if the lock was successfully acquired.

The monitor id C<$id> is an arbitrary string that identifies
the thread or process that seeks to acquire the resource.
In this function and in the other public functions of
C<Patro::Archy>, there is an implementation limitation
that the monitor id be no more than 20 characters.

If a positive C<$timeout> argument is provided, the function
will give up trying to acquire the lock and return false after
C<$timeout> seconds. If C<$timeout> is negative, the function
call will be treated as a I<non-blocking> lock call, and the
function will return as soon as it can be determined whether
the lock is available.

It is acceptable to call C<plock> for a monitor that already
possesses the lock. Successive lock calls "stack", so that you
must call L<"punlock"> the same number of times that you called
C<plock> on a reference (or provide a C<$count> argument to
L<"punlock">) before it will be released.


=head2 punlock

=head2 $status = punlock($object, $id[, $count])

Releases the lock on reference C<$object> held by the monitor
identified by C<$id>. Returns true on success. A false return
value generally means that the monitor did not have possession
of the lock at the time of the C<punlock> call.

A positive C<$count> argument, if provided, will apply the
unlock operation C<$count> times. Since lock calls from the
same monitor "stack" (see L<"plock">), it may be necessary to
apply the unlock operation more than once to release control of
the reference. A negative C<$count> argument will
release control of the reference unconditionally.


=head2 pwait

=head2 $status = pwait($object, $id [, $timeout])

Releases the lock on reference C<$object> and waits for the
L<"pnotify"> function to be called from another monitor.
After the L<"pnotify"> call is received by the monitor,
the monitor will attempt to acquire the lock on the resource
again. The monitor is only supposed to call this function
when it is in possession of the lock.

Returns true after the lock has been successfully acquired.
Returns false if the function is called while the monitor
does not have the lock on the resource, or if C<$timeout>
is specified and it takes longer than C<$timeout> seconds
to acquire the lock.

=head2 pnotify

=head2 $status = pnotify($object, $id [, $count])

Causes one or more (depending whether C<$count> is specified)
monitors that have previously called L<"pwait"> to wake up and
attempt to reacquire the lock on the resource. The monitor
is supposed to call this function while it is in possession
of the lock. Note that this call does not release the
resource. Returns true on success.


=head2 LIMITATIONS

Currently only works on systems that have a shared-memory
virtual filesystem in C</dev/shm>.
