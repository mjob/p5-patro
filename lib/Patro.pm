=head1 NAME

Patro - proxy access to remote objects

=head1 VERSION

0.12

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # on machine 1 (server)
    use Patro;
    my $obj = ...
    $config = patronize($obj);
    $config->to_file( 'config_file' );


    # on machines 2 through n (clients)
    use Patro;
    my ($proxy) = Patro->new( 'config_file' )->getProxies;
    ...
    $proxy->{key} = $val;         # updates $obj->{key} for obj on server
    $val = $proxy->method(@args); # calls $obj->method for obj on server


=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Patro> is a mechanism for making any Perl reference in one Perl program
accessible is other processes, even processes running on different hosts.
The "proxy" references have the same look and feel as the native references
in the original process, and any manipulation of the proxy reference
will have an effect on the original reference.

=head2 Some important features:

=over 4

=item * Hash members and array elements

Accessing or updating hash values or array values on a remote reference
is done with the same syntax as with the local reference:

    # host 1
    use Patro;
    my $hash1 = { abc => 123, def => [ 456, { ghi => "jkl" }, "mno" ] };
    my $config = patronize($hash1);
    ...

    # host 2
    use Patro;
    my $hash2 = Patro->new($config)->getProxies;
    print $hash2->{abc};                # "123"
    $hash2->{def}[2] = "pqr";           # updates $hash1 on host 1
    print delete $hash2->{def}[1]{ghi}; # "jkl", updates $hash1 on host1

=item * Remote method calls

Method calls on the proxy object are propagated to the original object,
affecting the remote object and returning the result of the call.

    # host 1
    use Patro;
    sub Foofie::new { bless \$_[1],'Foofie' }
    sub Foofie::blerp { my $self=shift; wantarray ? (5,6,7,$$self) : ++$$self }
    patronize(Foofie->new(17))->to_file('/config/file');
    ...

    # host 2
    use Patro;
    my $foo = Patro->new('/config/file')->getProxies;
    my @x = $foo->blerp;           # (5,6,7,17)
    my $x = $foo->blerp;           # 18

=item * Overloaded operators

Any overloaded operations on the original object are supported on the
remote object.

    # host 1
    use Patro;
    my $obj = Barfie->new(2,5);
    $config = patronize($obj);
    $config->to_file( 'config' );
    package Barfie;
    use overload '+=' => sub { $_ += $_[1] for @{$_[0]->{vals}};$_[0] },
         fallback => 1;
    sub new {
        my $pkg = shift;
        bless { vals => [ @_ ] }, $pkg;
    }
    sub prod { my $self = shift; my $z=1; $z*=$_ for @{$_[0]->{vals}}; $z }

    # host 2
    use Patro;'
    my $proxy = getProxies('config');
    print $proxy->prod;      # calls Barfie::prod($obj) on host1, 2 * 5 => 10
    $proxy += 4;             # calls Barfie '+=' sub on host1
    print $proxy->prod;      # 6 * 9 => 54

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 patronize

    CONFIG = patronize(@REFS)

Creates a server on the local machine that provides proxy access to
the given list of references. It returns an object
with information about how to connect to the server. 

The returned object has C<to_string> and C<to_file> methods
to store the configuration where it can be read by other processes.
Either the object, its string representation, or the filename 
containing config information may be used as input to the
L<"getProxies"> function to retrieve proxies to the shared
references.

=head2 getProxies

    PROXIES = getProxies(CONFIG)
    PROXIES = getProxies(STRING)
    PROXIES = getProxies(FILENAME)

Connects to a server on another machine, specified in the C<CONFIG>
string, and returns proxies to the list of references that are served.
In scalar context, returns a proxy to the first reference that is
served.

See the L<"PROXIES"> section below for what you can do with the output
of this function.

=head2 ref

    TYPE = Patro::ref(PROXY)

For the given proxy object, returns the ref type of the remote object
being served. If the input is not a proxy, returns C<undef>.
See also L<"reftype">.

=head2 reftype

    TYPE = Patro::reftype(PROXY)

Returns the simple reference type (e.g., C<ARRAY>) of the remote
object associated with the given proxy, as if we were calling
C<Scalar::Util::reftype> on the remote object. Returns C<undef> if
the input is not a proxy object.

=head2 client

    CLIENT = Patro::client(PROXY)

Returns the IPC client object used by the given proxy to communicate
with the remote object server. The client object contains information
about how to communicate with the server and other connection 
configuration.

=head1 PROXIES

Proxy references, as returned by the L<"getProxies"> function above,
or sometimes returned in other calls to the server, are designed
to look and feel as much as possible as the real references on the
remote server that they provide access to, so any operation or
expression with the proxy on the local machine should evaluate
to the same value(s) as the same operation or expression with the
real object/reference on the remote server. 
When the server if using threads and is sharing the served
objects between threads, an update to the
proxy object will affect the remote object, and vice versa.

=head2 Example 1: network file synchronization

Network file systems are notoriously flaky when it comes to
synchronizing files that are being written to by processes on
many different hosts [citation needed]. C<Patro> provides a
workaround, in that every machine can hold to a proxy to an object
that writes to a file, with the object running on a single machine.

    # master
    package SyncWriter;
    use Fcntl qw(:flock SEEK_END);
    sub new {
        my ($pkg,$filename) = @_;
        open my $fh, '>', $filename;
        bless { fh => $fh }, $pkg;
    }
    sub print {
        my $self = shift;
        flock $self->{fh}, LOCK_EX;
        seek $self->{fh}, 0, SEEK_END;
        print {$self->{fh}} @_;
        flock $self->{fh}, LOCK_UN;
    }
    sub printf { ... }

    use Patro;
    my $writer = SyncWriter->new("file.log");
    my $cfg = patronize($writer);
    open my $fh,'>','/network/accessible/file';
    print $fh $cfg;
    close $fh;
    ...

    # slaves
    use Patro;
    open my $fh, '<', '/network/accessible/file';
    my $cfg = <$fh>;
    close $fh;
    my $writer = Patro->new($cfg)->getProxies;
    ...
    # $writer->print with a proxy $writer
    # invokes $writer->print on the host. Since all
    # the file operations are done on a single machine,
    # there are no network synchronization issues
    $writer->print("a log message\n");
    ...

=head2 Example 2: Distributed queue

A program that distributes tasks to several threads or several
child processes can be extended to distribute tasks to
several machines.

    # master
    use Patro;
    my $queue = [ 'job 1', 'job 2', ... ];
    patronize($queue)->to_file('/network/accessible/file');
    ...

    # slaves
    use Patro;
    my $queue = Patro->new('/network/accessible/file')->getProxies;

    while (my $task = shift @$queue) {
        ... do task ...
    }

(This example will not work without threads. For a more robust
network-safe queue that will run with forks, see L<Forks::Queue>)

=head2 Example 3: Keep your code secret

If you distribute your Perl code for others to use, it is very
difficult to keep others from being able to see (and potentially
steal) your code. L<Obfuscators|Acme::Bleach> are penetrable by
any determined reverse engineer. Most other suggestions for keeping
your code secret revolve around running your code on a server,
and having your clients send input and receive output through a
network service.

The C<Patro> framework can make this service model easier to use.
Design a small set of objects that can execute your code, provide
your clients with a public API for those objects, and make proxies
to your objects available through C<Patro>.

    # code to run on client machine
    use Patro;
    my $cfg = ...    # provided by you
    my ($obj1,$obj2) = Patro->new($cfg)->getProxies;
    $result = $obj1->method($arg1,$arg2);
    ...

In this model, the client can use the objects and methods of your code,
and inspect the members of your objects through the proxies, but the
client cannot see the source code.


=head1 ENVIRONMENT

C<Patro> pays attention to the following environment variables.

=head2 PATRO_THREADS

If the environment variable C<PATRO_THREADS> is set, C<Patro> will use
it to determine whether to use a forked server or a threaded server
to provide proxy access to objects. If this variable is not set,
C<Patro> will use threads if the L<threads> module can be loaded.
